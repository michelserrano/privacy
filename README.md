## Privacy Policy

OUR COMPANY develops and publishes social games for the web and mobile devices (the “Service”). OUR COMPANY is committed to protecting the privacy of its users ("users" or "you"). This Privacy Policy has been created to inform you about how OUR COMPANY manages, collects, stores and uses the information you provide in connection with any OUR COMPANY game. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited only to information collected by OUR COMPANY through your use of a Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. OUR COMPANY may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time, and OUR COMPANY encourages you to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes. If you do not agree to the policy, you can opt out of the services.

### Information Collected

OUR COMPANY's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to enjoy the Service.

### Personal Information

“Personal information” means information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, for example:

(1) Your first and last name (or the name you have associated with your device);
(2) Your social network or third party service user identification number (like your Facebook ID number), which is linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo (including the social network ID numbers and other public data of your friends);
(3) Your mobile device's unique identifier (UDID);
(4) Your telephone number;
(5) Transaction identifiers for purchases;
(6) Your email address used to login the social network;
(7) Your profile picture or its URL;
(8) Any other relevant information included in your application, social network or other online profile.

OUR COMPANY does not receive, collect or record any personal information about you.

Please note that because a third party site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, OUR COMPANY does not have access to your credit card details or billing information.

### Non-Personal Information

“Non-personal information” is information that, when taken alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you, for example:

(1) Your age and date of birth;
(2) Your gender;

(4) Your country;
(5) If applicable, your physical geolocation and that of the devices you use to access our Services;

### Links

The Service may contain links to other websites or applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or application or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that OUR COMPANY endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link to a third party site or application, including on an advertisement, you will leave the OUR COMPANY site you are visiting or application you are running and will go to the site or application linked to. These third party websites and applications may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites and applications follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Because OUR COMPANY cannot control the activities of third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and it cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as OUR COMPANY. You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites and applications you visit before providing any personal information.
